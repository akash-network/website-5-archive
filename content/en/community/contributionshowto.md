# Community Contributions : How to Guide

## What are Community Contributions?
With the Akash community growing rapidly and numerous community members creating Akash related content, the need for a central repository of community 
content is needed. However, not all content is equal and some content may need a little TLC before being added to the repo.

This guide is a best practices and checklist for getting your contributions added to the Akash Networks community contributions page.

## Content Definitions
There are two types of content that will be added to the Community contributions section of the Akash website:

### Written Content
This can include any educational, informative or general information about the Akash Network and its ecosystem

### Video Content
This can include any educational, informative or general information about the Akash Network and its ecosystem

## Content Approvals
Content approvals are fairly straightforward. Content will be approved if:
- It is relevant to the Akash Network
- It is educational, informative or relevant to the Akash Network and its ecosystem
- It has limited grammatical errors

Content will not be approved OR will need updating before approval if:
- It has numerous grammatical errors
- It has no relevance to the Akash Network

## Adding your content

* Make a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request)
* Please include the below information in your PR:
  * Title of content [linked URL to content]
  * Author Information [link to author information]
  * Date of Content
  * Overview of Content
  * 2-3 sentences about the information within your content piece
