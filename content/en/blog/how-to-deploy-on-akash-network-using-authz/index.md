AuthZ is a feature that allows one wallet to spend the funds in another wallet, up to a specified limit.

-----------------------------

Let’s walk through a simple “Hello World” deployment with Cloudmos' deploy tool, using AuthZ to pay for the deployment.

After following the on-screen instructions to set up your Cloudmos wallet and create a certificate, you should see the screen below:
