**Are you ready Akashian Challengers?!**   

**Week 2 of The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 is officially LIVE!!!**  

With 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) rewards at stake, Phase 3 testnet has already seen record participation from developers around the world and plenty of action just in the first week.  

During Week 1, we had significant firsts. Forbole deployed their Big Dipper on Akash DeCloud, making it the first instance of a prominent block explorer to migrate from centralized cloud to decentralized cloud. Additionally, [Serum](https://dex.projectserum.com) DEX UI became the first instance a major DeFi project is hosted on the DeCloud.  

Week 1 by the numbers:

*   830 application deployments
    
*   249 participants
    
*   142 registered validators
    
*   100 active Validators
    
*   100+ validators and nodes running on Akash
    
*   200 web apps
    
*   181 multi-tier applications
    

Week 2 starts today, and challenges will focus on leveraging Akash DeCloud to deploy various node types and components for a live blockchain network. We’ll provide connection details for a live Cosmos SDK-based network.

Start the Week 2 challenges by clicking [Get Started Now](https://docs.akash.network/testnet-challenges/testnet-challenges/guided-deployments), or click on Learn More to visit The Akashian Challenge site for more information on Week 2 challenges and rewards.

#### **Goals & Overview**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

Integrating performance enhancements from Cosmos SDK v0.40, The Akashian Challenge Testnet 3 will test and showcase Akash DeCloud’s deployment platform. Akashian Challengers will be incentivized to deploy applications using the Akash Network.

Encompassing two weeks, Phase 3 will include **guided challenges** for deploying applications of increasing complexity — from simple single-page applications to blockchain network components, and **open ended challenges** where users can show off their Akash OPS skills by extending the guided examples to deploy any application they desire — from DeFi to CI.

There are additional rewards for participation outside of the deployment challenges, including contributions such as active validator participation, writing blog posts and how-to guides, and sharing novel uses of our platform.

**Phase 3 Goals:**

*   Test platform functionality for Mainnet 2
    
*   Distribute tokens to potential users for Mainnet 2
    
*   Build a catalog of applications (SDLs) to launch Mainnet 2
    

**Phase 3 Challenges:**

*   Guided Challenges 
    
    *   These challenges are meant to be used as step-by-step guides to deploying applications on our network.
        
    *   Each challenge will have accompanying instructions and example deployment configurations.  
        
*   Open Ended Challenges
    
    *   As a generic cloud platform, Akash DeCloud has the potential to be used in a wide variety of use cases. This open-ended challenge is meant to explore what kinds of applications can be deployed on DeCloud, and how.
        
    *   You’ll support the Akash DeCloud community by finding unique applications to deploy and sharing your deployment configuration via a pull request on Awesome Akash.  
        
*   Network Support Challenges
    
    *   While validators and other network components are not necessarily targeted in this testnet, they are of course essential to maintaining a healthy DeCloud. 
        
    *   Leverage this testnet to practice your operations, or try new ones.
        
    *   To earn rewards for this challenge, you should be actively participating — keep your component(s) up-to-date and respond to any network proposals that may come up.  
        
*   Community Content Challenges
    
    *   Drop your knowledge about Akash DeCloud to earn rewards. The community content challenges support community members who independently publish articles and guides related to the Akash Network. 
        
        *   **Anything Goes**: An open-ended category where "Anything Goes!" with community-generated content related to Akash. 
            
        *   **DeCloud for DeFi**: A category calling on our community to leverage Akash DeCloud as the infrastructure supporting DeFi applications. 
            

Phase 3 will accelerate our vision for a decentralized and open cloud computing marketplace and serve as the launchpad for Mainnet 2.
