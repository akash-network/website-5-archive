**This past month was a month of acceleration for Akash**. After completion of a successful Phase 1 of The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet, we launched the 3 weeks long Phase 2 to test and demonstrate the decentralized exchange features of our cloud platform. 

We also expanded our global vision for the future of the cloud and launched our Chinese Community channels with a WeChat AMA hosted by OG Group, broadcast to 5,000 new community members. We’re excited to increase participation in our platform through a new partnership with Lunie Wallet, enabling more users to participate in the economic security of Akash’s blockchain.

It takes a tenacious and talented team to build a future at the intersection of cloud, blockchain, and machine learning. We’re thrilled to welcome our newest team members **Jack Zampolin, Olive Kimoto, Michael Gushansky, and Cheng Wang**. More about each of these extraordinary individuals below.

As more of people’s lives continue to transition to the cloud, our team is even more committed to progressing **a future that provides faster, better, and significantly lower cost access to the cloud, enabling greater growth and innovation for organizations of all sizes.**

Phase 2 of The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet, is [currently underway](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-2-week-2-chaos-is-a-ladder/) and **encompasses 3 weeks of challenges, 600,000 AKT rewards, and special prizes.**  

The Akashian Challenge Phase 2 introduces, demonstrates, and tests the decentralized exchange features of Akash. This decentralized exchange (DEX) is different from others in the cryptocurrency world, which are focused on settling trades; the Akash DEX is designed to settle requests for application deployments. Track our progress on [Forbole’s The Big Dipper](https://testnet.akash.bigdipper.live/) and [Vitwit’s Aneka](https://akash.aneka.io/) block explorers.

At Akash Network, outside of the US, our Chinese audience makes up the second largest group of visitors to our website and communities. We’re also fortunate to have a number of Chinese investors and partners, including [Outpost Capital](https://outpostvc.com/), [Hone Capital](http://honecap.com/), [Forbole](https://www.forbole.com/), and [Steven Fan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenweifan/) of Tencent

This past month, we launched the Akash Network Chinese Community, and expanded our vision globally for the world’s first decentralized cloud marketplace. We welcomed Chinese audiences to our new Chinese [website](https://akash.network/about/?lang=zh-hans) and WeChat. We also hosted an AMA with OG Group that was broadcast to 5,000 attendees.

We’re excited to announce an integration and partnership with Lunie Wallet. Lunie is a non-custodial staking tool that allows users to safely store, manage and stake crypto assets in Proof of Stake (PoS) networks. 

We’ve been admirers of Lunie’s user experience, ease of set-up, and deep integration with Cosmos validators. As a trusted wallet in the Cosmos ecosystem, Lunie provides a great user interface to simplify delegation, voting, and staking.

With a reputable and high integrity team led by CEO Jordan Bibla, Lunie is a company we’d wanted to partner with to enable more users to participate in the economic security of Akash’s blockchain.
