Outside of the US, Akash’s Russian audience is our _second largest community_. We’ve also been fortunate to have a number of Russian participants among the 106 validators in The Akashian Challenge, our incentivized testnet.

**That’s why today, we’re excited to announce the launch of the Akash Network Russian Community, and expand our global vision for the world’s first decentralized cloud marketplace.**

We welcome Russian audiences around the world to learn more about Akash Network and Akash Token (AKT) by visiting our Russian [website](https://akash.network/?lang=ru) and joining our [Russian Telegram Group](https://t.me/akash_ru).

> After graduating with a Master’s Degree in Foreign Economics and Communication, and a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and Auditing, I worked as an Economist at a bank for 6 years. Working with customers daily allowed me to learn more about people’s behaviors, and how to support them with different types of solutions. I left my role at the bank in search of new opportunities, and started trading stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ--I’m still trading.  
> 
> At the end of 2017, my friends gave me a present--0.5 ETH and a wallet. That was the first cryptocurrency I got. I was so excited and started to learn more about blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, new blockchain projects, and decentralization. I started to research and trade crypto every day, and became a community moderator. It became my passion. Now I can’t imagine my life without crypto, trading, and the crypto community.  
>   
> I believe that Akash is a game changer in the cloud computing industry. The project has a great vision of the future, a world where cloud computing is permissionless, sovereign, and open. I look forward to helping the team build that future.

#### **Community AMAs with Gagarin & Solana Russia**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**  

**In support of the Russian Community launch this week, the Gagarin Crypto Group hosted an AMA in their Telegram group on Monday, July 20th at 9AM PST / 4PM UTC featuring Akash CEO Greg Osuri and VP of Product Jack Zampolin.**

Gagarin's community is one of the most influential among Russian audiences. Their Telegram group has about 4,000 members made up of Russian and CIS traders and investors. They review projects, share investment ideas, and conduct trading. They have a very active community, and we found our AMA with them one of the most exciting and rewarding AMAs we’ve participated in.  
  
We were impressed with the level of engagement, and the depth of the questions the Gagarin community asked us. We probably got inundated with about 150 insightful and thoughtful questions during our AMA--you can check out the action in the video.

**This Thursday at 9AM PST / 4PM UTC, Solana’s Russian Community is hosting Greg and Jack in their Telegram group. We’ll be sharing more about our partnership and technology integration with Solana.**
