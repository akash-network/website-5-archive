Akash Network has been selected by Kava Labs as the preferred distributed cloud hosting solution for the Kava Ecosystem. Akash began integration with Kava in September 2020, and continues to work closely with the Kava Labs team to support cross-chain DeFi applications and services. The Kava Platform connects the world’s largest cryptocurrencies, ecosystems, and financial applications. 

We are expanding our partnership with Kava to provide distributed, censorship-resistant cloud hosting for all frontend applications of protocols launching on the Kava Ecosystem. Every Kava project will have the compute power they need as a grant of AKT. 

> “We’re proud to be able to provide a decentralized solution for cloud compute to Kava Labs and its ecosystem. Hosting the decentralized version of the Kava App along with their analytics dashboard is one step closer to a truly decentralized Internet.”
> 
> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network

### Tell Me More About Kava 

The Kava Platform is a Layer-1 network that combines powerful scalability and institutional-grade security to connect the world’s biggest crypto assets and ecosystems. Built using a robust Go Language architecture and the Cosmos SDK, the Kava Platform is built to power a DeFi ecosystem with better safety, user experience, and performance than traditional financial products and services. 

> “The Kava Ecosystem is all about creating the most secure and scalable decentralized platform for DeFi. “As our preferred cloud provider, Akash Network will empower developers to bring that decentralization all the way through to the frontend of their applications.” 
> 
> Scott Stuart, CEO of Kava Labs

The Kava Ecosystem is a suite of best-in-class DeFi services powered by the Kava Platform and connected to a global network via Kava’s partners. The goal of the Kava Ecosystem is to deliver secure, meaningful scale by creating a trusted environment for mainstream users to access the value of DeFi. 

### Hosting, Compute and AKT  

The partnership will initially focus on bolstering the decentralization of the current Kava Ecosystem. This includes a mirrored version of the [Kava App](https://app.kava.io/balances) frontend hosted on Akash as well as a decentralized ecosystem analytics dashboard.

As the next recipient of Kava’s Ignition funding to further decentralize the Kava Ecosystem, we will also be providing upcoming Kava Ecosystem projects with compute credits in the form of our utility token, AKT, to support the hosting of decentralized frontends. In turn, Akash users will now have access to a new blockchain with the opportunity to deploy their projects directly to the Kava Ecosystem.

The long-term goal of the partnership is to implement decentralized frontend applications for every piece of the Kava Ecosystem, making it the first truly decentralized ecosystem in DeFi.

### What’s Next? 

With our shared goal to evolve decentralization in a secure way, this partnership with Kava is another step in the right direction. We look forward to seeing what new projects this partnership brings and are excited to continue working with Kava on other initiatives in the spirit of advancing decentralization.
