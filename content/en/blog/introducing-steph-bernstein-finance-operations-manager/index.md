> _**I was incredibly impressed with the team behind Akash Network and what they’ve already accomplished as an early-stage startup. I’m excited to have a front-row seat to witness the way Akash’s intersection of cloud computing, blockchain, and cryptocurrency will change the Internet as we know it.**_

Taking on the $370 billion cloud industry with the successful launch of Akash MAINNET 2, the world’s first decentralized open-source cloud and the only alternative to centralized cloud services, we’re wasting no time when it comes to expanding the team, and priming Akash DeCloud for maximum acceleration and growth.   

Since Akash Network launched 5 years ago, the team has put in a lot of work to ensure that Akash DeCloud meets the needs of developers and high-growth companies, while growing a global community and partner ecosystem of leading technology companies like Equinix Metal and Cosmos.  

After a foundational year of milestones, we’re excited to establish strong internal infrastructure and processes to enable our team to accelerate growth this year. To support this effort, we’re proud to announce our first Finance & Operations Manager, Steph Bernstein, who brings over a decade of experience managing business operations.   

Having supported significant growth at a Madison Avenue private equity firm and an award-winning creative marketing and PR agency in New York City, Steph comes to us with extensive hands-on experience growing teams, overseeing office expansions, creating and implementing company policies and procedures, and shaping company culture.   

She has always been interested in new technology developments and the impact they have on our work and ultimately on our lives.    

#### **On Establishing a Dynamic Company Culture**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

With the mindset that our people are our most valuable asset, Steph believes it is important to build a dynamic and positive culture by making sure every team member is cared for and has a sense of purpose and ownership in their work.   

Through employee wellness, inclusion, empowerment, connection, and gratitude, Steph has seen how company culture can be directly influenced by operations and the crucial role it plays in overall employee satisfaction.  

Her main goals to support company growth at Akash are to provide knowledge and training to the team, to build great company culture, to recruit and retain top talent, and to maximize company productivity by implementing a structure that best supports our team.

> _I was drawn to Akash for many reasons. I was incredibly impressed with the team and what they had already accomplished as an early-stage startup disrupting the cloud computing market._  
>   
> _Most importantly, Akash’s company culture and key values aligned really well with that of my own. It was refreshing to know that empathy and equality were so highly regarded._   
>   
> _I am excited to make positive and meaningful contributions to Akash and in turn have a front-row seat to witness the way Akash’s intersection of cloud computing, blockchain, and cryptocurrency will change the Internet as we know it._

Currently, Steph is working fast and furiously to expand employee benefits while supporting recruiting and onboarding.   

What Steph is looking forward to working on:   

> _I look forward to working with our CFO on our financial and accounting structure. I also look forward to getting more involved in the day-to-day operational functions of the organization._

A natural problem solver with a passion for improving the lives of those around her, Steph loves thoughtful design, travel, and her 50lb rescue mutt.   

> _I have a strong appreciation for interesting architecture, smart interiors, furniture, and lighting design. I am interested in how these design elements are created and how they work. I believe this curiosity influences my ability to think outside the box when it comes to solving problems related to my work._   
>   
> _As Akash is a remote-first organization, I will have the freedom to travel when the world opens back up and still stay connected to my team. I believe this freedom will positively influence my work product simply based on my level of happiness. I also get to work with my dog by my side daily, which is hard to beat._
