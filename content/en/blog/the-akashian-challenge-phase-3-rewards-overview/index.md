Last Thursday, we shared a teaser of [The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations](https://akash.network/blog/the-akashian-challenge-phase-3-teaser/), the third and final phase of our incentivized testnet. 

Inspired by ecosystem projects from our partners and friends, such as Cosmos Game of Stakes, Solana Tour de Sol, and Kava Founder Rewards, The Akashian Challenge enables you to explore our decentralized cloud and help us strengthen and secure our platform.

**With 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) in rewards, and validators and developers joining from around the world, The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations will test your technical and social cunning through a series of tasks and open-ended challenges that get progressively more difficult.**  

**Ready to get started?! Check out our challenges and token rewards overview below, and get ready for instructions next Wednesday, November 25, 2020.**  
  
_**May Akash be with you!**_

####   
**Phase 3: Developer Operations Overview**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

Integrating performance enhancements from Cosmos SDK v0.40, The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 will test and showcase Akash DeCloud’s deployment platform. Akashian Challengers will be incentivized to deploy applications using the Akash Network.

Encompassing two weeks, Phase 3 will include **guided challenges** for deploying applications of increasing complexity — from simple single-page applications to blockchain network components, and **open ended challenges** where users can show off their Akash OPS skills by extending the guided examples to deploy any application they desire — from DeFi to CI.

There are additional rewards for participation outside of the deployment challenges, including contributions such as active validator participation, writing blog posts and how-to guides, and sharing novel uses of our platform.

**The Akashian Challenge Phase 3: Developer Operations will launch on Monday, November 30th at 1700 UTC / 9:00AM PST. Phase 3 will encompass two weeks of challenges.**  

  
**Phase 3 Goals:**

*   Test platform functionality for Mainnet 2
    
*   Distribute tokens to potential users for Mainnet 2
    
*   Build a catalog of applications (SDLs) to launch Mainnet 2
    

**Phase 3 Challenges:**

*   Guided Challenges
    
*   Open Ended Challenges
    

Phase 3 will accelerate our vision for a decentralized and open cloud computing marketplace and serve as the launchpad for Mainnet 2.   

####   
**Key Dates**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

The Phase 3 network and challenges will be live during the week of November 30, 2020 - December 4, 2020 and the week of December 7, 2020 - December 11, 2020.

Rewards from the first week will be posted on December 14, 2020. Complete results of rewards will be posted on December 21, 2020.

_**Scoring Note**__: where submissions satisfy more than one reward, all rewards will be granted for that submission._

####   
**Phase 3 Guided Challenges**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

Guided challenges are meant to be used as step-by-step guides to deploying applications on our network.

Each challenge will have accompanying instructions and example deployment configurations.

####   
**Week 1**

In Week 1, challenges will focus on deploying stand-alone applications, from website deployments to single-node blockchain networks.

#### **Week 2**

In Week 2, challenges will focus on leveraging Akash to deploy various node types and components for a live blockchain network. We’ll provide connection details for a live Cosmos SDK-based network.

####   
**Phase 3 Open Ended Challenges**  
**\_\_\_\_\_**

**Open-Ended Deployment Challenge**

As a generic cloud platform, Akash DeCloud has the potential to be used in a wide variety of use cases. This open-ended challenge is meant to explore what kinds of applications can be deployed on DeCloud, and how.

You’ll support the Akash DeCloud community by finding unique applications to deploy and sharing your deployment configuration via a pull request on [Awesome Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash).

**Network Support Rewards**

While validators and other network components are not necessarily targeted in this testnet, they are of course essential to maintaining a healthy DeCloud. 

Leverage this testnet to practice your operations, or try new ones.

To earn rewards for this challenge, you should be actively participating — keep your component(s) up-to-date and respond to any network proposals that may come up.

**Community Content Rewards**

Drop your knowledge about Akash DeCloud to earn rewards. The community content challenges support community members who independently publish articles and guides related to the Akash Network. 

**Community Content Rewards Categories:**

1.  **Anything Goes**: An open-ended category where "Anything Goes!" with community-generated content related to Akash. 
    
2.  **DeCloud for DeFi:** A category calling on our community to leverage Akash DeCloud as the infrastructure supporting DeFi applications. 
    

**1) Anything Goes**

For the first category, here are _Anything Goes_ ideas for you to explore:

*   [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) (Forum) - widely used crypto forums
    
*   [Wiki JS](https://wiki.js.org/) (Wiki) - beautiful open source Wiki
    
*   [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) (Messaging) - Slack alternative
    
*   [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) (CI / CD) - Github alternative
    
*   [N8N](https://n8n.io/) ( Task Automation) - Zapier alternative
    
*   [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) (Blogging) - Medium alternative
    
*   [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) (Private Video Conferencing) - running en ephemeral Jitsi server would be the gold standard of private video conferencing

**2) DeCloud for DeFi Rewards**

For the second category, Akash DeCloud's platform ensures DeFi protocols [remain sovereign and more accessible](https://akash.network/blog/akash-decloud-for-defi/). 

In this bonus challenge, we’re asking the community to help us demonstrate Akash’s capabilities to support DeFi.
