Even though we started off 2022 with a bear market, this has been one of the strongest months not just for Akash Network, but for the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. 

Deployments on Akash’s distributed peer-to-peer network have more than [doubled](https://stats.akash.network/) through the month of January and daily Akash Token (AKT) spend is at an [all-time high](https://www.akashlytics.com/graph/daily-akt-spent). We’re seeing more and more dApps becoming truly decentralized by deploying on Akash, bringing the picture of what Web 3.0 will look like into focus.

Akash-powered dApps include decentralized exchanges such as [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/) and [Rango Exchange](https://rango.exchange/), various NFT and gaming platforms like [Strange Clan](https://strangeclan.com/) and [Craft Economy](https://crafteconomy.io/), and even media companies such as [Passage](https://passage3d.com/) and [OmniFlix Network](https://omniflix.network/).

Here is our month of January in review. 

### **Product Progress** 

*   **Introduction of streamlined Akash Provider build process** \- This allows users to install an Akash Provider in just a few steps (via Helm Charts). 
    
*   **Deployment remote shell access** \- Enables remote access to the command line (CLI) of a running deployment and allows copying of files to a remote deployment instance. Click [here](https://docs.akash.network/release-notes/v0.14.0#deployment-shell-access) to learn more. 
    
*   **Deployment hostname migration** \- Allows migration of a hostname between a legacy deployment and a new deployment. This upgrade also limits deployment to minimal downtime during application updates and migrations. Click [here](https://docs.akash.network/release-notes/v0.14.0#hostname-migration) to learn more.
    

### **Partnerships**

ColdStack, a decentralized cloud aggregator offers a portal to access any decentralized storage network such as Filecoin, Crust, Sia, Arweave, Storj, among others. With a shared vision for a decentralized web, this month ColdStack has announced plans to deploy on Akash in order to expand its node network capabilities and scale.

We were able to sit down with Justin Silver, Head of Communications at Coldstack and our Director of DevRels, Eric Zietlow to discuss plans to deploy on Akash. We also hosted regional AMA’s with our Korean, Chinese, and Russian communities.

This month, we announced that Akash Network now supports [Chia Network](https://www.chia.net/), an open-source blockchain, and smart transaction platform, enabling Chia users to create NFT plots on-demand with just a few clicks. 

As the world's first dWeb platform to support plot creation on its network, Akash Network is equipped with the advanced hardware requirements that plotting requires. This unlocks opportunities for intermediate and beginner farmers alike, allowing them to monetize on idle hardware used for mining. 

Our Head of Mining, Andrew Mello sat down with the VP Storage at Chia, Jonmichael Hands to discuss farming and plotting on Akash and provided a demo. 

### **Listings**
