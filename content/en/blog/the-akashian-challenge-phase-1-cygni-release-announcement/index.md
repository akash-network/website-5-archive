**Quick facts about The Akashian Challenge Incentivized Testnet:**

*   **211 Teams**
    
*   **99 Active Validators (for 64 spots at Mainnet)**
    
*   **#2 Largest Testnet in the Cosmos Hub (after Game of Stakes)**
    
*   **#2 Largest Testnet after Ethereum 2.0**
    

Earlier this week, we conducted a testnet reboot to Centauri 2 and resolved upgrade module issues in the last version of our testnet. We appreciate the feedback and participation of Akashians to help us build a stronger Mainnet.   
  
**Today, we announce Cygni, the fourth and final release in Phase 1 of The Akashian Challenge.** With 3,000,000 AKT in rewards, Supermini prizes, and 64 validator spots for Mainnet, the stakes are even higher going into Phase 2.  
  
The goal of Cygni release is to ensure frictionless upgrades, and to identify and correct coordination gaps. The release will include updates to params and staking to reduce the voting power centralization of genesis validator(s).  The Cygni Network Upgrade proposal **goes live for voting Friday May 29th at 1600 UTC**.   
  
**Please be sure** to check the schedule and details below before voting.
