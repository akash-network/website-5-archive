As you may know, we are working hard to build [Akash](https://akash.network/), the open, decentralized marketplace for cloud compute. As much as we are in product mode at the moment, we also love the opportunity to connect with the community, check out other exciting projects and discuss the ever-changing blockchain world. Luckily, conferences allow us to do just that.

We are thrilled to announce that our CEO & Co-Founder, Greg Osuri, will be a featured speaker at [Blockchain Developer Conference](http://blockdevcon.com/) on April 19 and 20th in Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco. Greg will be giving a talk on Thursday, April 19th on the decentralized future of cloud infrastructure. Details are listed below, we hope to see you there!
