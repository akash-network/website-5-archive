Today is the day! Akash's Mainnet 4 upgrade is on track to reach the specified block height within a few minutes of 6:15 PM GMT / 1:15 PM EST / 10:15 AM PST.

[Keep an eye on the estimated upgrade timing here](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/blocks/8526250\).

Mainnet 4 features
------------------

1.  **IP Leases**  
    IP Leases will allow tenants on Akash to request a publicly routable IP address for the services they deploy. Today, you get an HTTP endpoint connected to your service, and Kubernetes assigns the actual port. With IP Leases, a tenant on Akash can request a dedicated IPV4 address, allowing users to assign a specific port instead of a randomly assigned port.
    
2.  **Provider Services Split**  
    This feature will separate parts of the behind-the-scenes development process for Overclock Labs and make it easier to iterate quickly and efficiently.
    
3.  **Cosmos IBC3**  
    IBC3 allows one chain to send transactions to another chain. This gives users access to the latest IBC Cosmos features and opens Akash Network to the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem.
    
4.  **Interchain Accounts (ICA)**  
    By enabling Interchain Accounts, we will provide access to interchain composability and significantly improve the user experience on Akash Network.
