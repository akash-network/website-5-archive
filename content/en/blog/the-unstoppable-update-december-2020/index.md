As more of our work and play continues to transition to the cloud, the need for a more flexible, scalable and lower cost cloud has never been greater. 

With the successful launch of The Akashian Challenge Phase 3, one of the most ambitious testnets in the ecosystem, and our second exchange listing on BitMart this past month, we continue to accelerate our vision of The Unstoppable Cloud.

We’ve been astounded by the level of global participation and excitement surrounding Phase 3, and we’re grateful to Akashian Challengers and our community for helping us build the world’s first decentralized cloud. 

Awesome stats from Phase 3:

*   2,438 Application Deployments
    
*   379 Developers
    
*   100 Active Validators
    

During Phase 3, [Serum DEX UI](https://dex.projectserum.com/#/) became the first instance a major DeFi project is hosted on the DeCloud.

Apps launched on Akash so far include Uniswap, Sushiswap, Steemit, Wordpress, Tetris and many more.

With 500,000 Akash Token (AKT) rewards at stake, The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 enables developers to explore the world’s first decentralized cloud and help us build a strong Mainnet 2, while earning AKT.

Phase 3 enables users to deploy web based cloud applications, such as static sites and API servers -- the most common DeFi application components. This phase also enabled dAPP developers to deploy blockchain nodes on our network as an alternative to expensive and inflexible cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud. 

Here’s some love we’ve received so far from our community:

As we wrap up Phase 3 of the Akashian Challenge we look forward to taking key learnings from this testnet and applying them to the launch of our Mainnet 2.
