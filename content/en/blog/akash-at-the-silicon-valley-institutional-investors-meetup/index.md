We are thrilled to share that Greg will be speaking at the upcoming [Silicon Valley Institutional Investors](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-valley-institutional-investors-iv-tickets-44568297979) event on Wednesday, April 11th. This event will feature a handful of discussions including how institutional investors are investing in the blockchain space and future trends of blockchain/crypto.

Greg will be joined by Prashant Fonseka of CrunchFund to discuss the topic “How Does CrunchFund Pick the Winners in the Blockchain/Crypto Space?”. This should be an interesting discussion as CrunchFund is an investor in Akash and have been a solid partner for us.
