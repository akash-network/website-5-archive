## Ecosystem Updates from Greg Osuri
Greg Osuri appeared on Coinage with Zack Guzmáñ. As Akash expands and grows, it is beginning to attract the attention of the large, centralized cloud providers.

> “The goal of Akash is to bring people to the table and create a multi-cloud standard…you’re going to have big clouds and small clouds at the same table—leveling the playing field. [This will] give the consumer the ultimate benefit. Optimizing the true cost of the cloud, while operating in a sovereign and open way.” —Greg Osuri

**Overclock Labs launched its latest deployment promotion.** Follow the link in the tweet below to sign up to receive free credits to deploy an RPC node on Akash for up to three months. As everyone heads home from Cosmoverse and begins to shift back to building—we want to make it easy for people to get up and running on the open cloud.


## Adam Bozanich and Anil Murty on the Vision of Overclock Console and Building Akash Network
**Adam Bozanich, CTO & Co-Founder of Overclock Labs (Creators of Akash Network)**. Led software development at Symantec, One King’s Lane, and Marketron. Before that, he worked as an engineer and developer for the music monetization platform Topspin—acquired by Apple in 2014 after an initial acquisition by Beats. Adam holds a U.S. patent for Network Protocol Fuzzing, a security analysis methodology.

**Anil Murty, Head of Product at Overclock Labs.** Anil is an Engineer turned Product Manager. He has a passion for building products that serve deeply technical users. He has worked on products ranging from consumer and enterprise hardware, software, and SaaS—and most recently, cloud-native developer and observability tooling. Anil is based in the beautiful city of Portland, OR.

### What’s exciting about Overclock Console, and who are its intended users?
Overclock Console fulfills much of the original vision for deploying on Akash Network. Akash network is already performant and cost-optimized. Console provides the last piece of the puzzle, making the deployment process on Akash easy and intuitive.

Over time, Console will give users of Akash access to one-click deployments to launch validators, RPC nodes, and more.

There are many ways to deploy on Akash today, with each deployment tool taking an opinionated approach to deployment. Because Akash is such an extensive network, it represents a wide-ranging marketplace for potential deployments. There is plenty of room in the layer above Akash for many different tools to help users deploy, each tailored to a unique deployment style or user workflow.

Overclock Labs’ approach to Console has been to focus on making sure that we provide the best tools for Validators within the Cosmos ecosystem to be able to spin up nodes—whether that is a full validator node, an RPC node, a sentry node, or anything else a Validator might want to deploy.

Past Cosmos, we will widen our focus to other chains, whether that is Solana, Ethereum, or any others.

### Mainnet 4 is coming soon.
Overclock is gearing up to launch Mainnet 4 for Akash Network. Thankfully, the major upgrades are easy to remember—as there are four.

Here are the four major upgrades of Mainnet 4:

1. IP Leases. This will allow tenants on Akash to request a publicly routable IP address for the services they deploy. Today, you get an HTTP endpoint connected to your service, and Kubernetes assign the actual port. With IP Leases, a tenant on Akash can request a dedicated IPV4 address, allowing users to assign a specific port instead of a randomly assigned port. This will unlock Solana node hosting on Akash Network.

2. Provider Services Split. This upgrade will separate parts of the behind-the-scenes development process for Overclock Labs and make it easy to iterate quickly as we build and grow Akash.

3. Cosmos IBC v3. IBC v3 and Interchain Accounts allow one chain to send transactions to another chain.

4. Interchain Accounts. By enabling Interchain Accounts on Akash, we will open up an entirely new world of interchain composability and significantly improve the user experience on Akash Network.

Our Akash Insiders were the first to gain access to IP Leases.

### The Internet Lost Its Way
In its way, the core vision for Akash Network is to bring the internet back to its roots.

“[The Internet] had turned into this thing, where if US-West-1 goes down on AWS—no apps work anymore. Clearly, there is a huge amount of centralization happening on the internet. That’s one of the things we wanted to address.” —Adam Bozanich

Akash is one step towards an internet that is more sovereign, independent, and open. An internet that works better for everyone.

## Q&A
Q: What is unique about Akash, and how will that impact AKT?
A: Akash is the first attempt at an open and decentralized cloud. This will reduce the premium we all end up paying the centralized cloud—which hosts most applications today.
