Overclock Console makes is easy and intuitive to create new deployments, and manage active deployments on Akash Network.

Spheron, and the Need for Decentralized Infrastructure
------------------------------------------------------

[Prashant Maurya](https://twitter.com/prashant_xyz), CEO & Co-Founder of [Spheron](https://spheron.network/), comes to Web3 with a background in healthcare, ERP, and HRMS. He was a solutions architect and led large teams across his career—spanning eight years. He believes that for Web3 to succeed, we will need scalable infrastructure that is native to Web3 and the ethos of decentralization.

The challenge in building web3 is finding decentralized infrastructure. The purpose of Spheron is to make the decentralized ecosystem accessible for developers and builders.

Spheron is launching its marketplace in the coming weeks. This will address the growing problem of developers wanting to move to Web3, and onto decentralized networks, but lacking a solution that is easy and intuitive.

Spheron will be launching on Optimism, Arbitrum, and eventually onto most EVM-compatible chains within the next 2-3 months. Behind the scenes, Akash Network will be facilitating access to decentralized compute—regardless of the chain.

Cheng Wang, CFO of Overclock Labs on Token Unlocks

Prior to Overclock Labs, Cheng served as the CFO for Workshop, a premier blockchain startup. He spent over eight years at premier financial institutions, before founding and managing his own retail businesses in NYC. His experience includes extended tenures with Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and RBS—where he served as a Vice President, focusing on debt and valuations. His financial expertise includes equity, debt valuations, derivatives instruments, and portfolio management.

Q&A
---

### Q: Is there any chance the team is planning to improve the volume and liquidity of AKT on centralized exchanges?

A: AKT is listed on Kraken, Ascendex, and Kucoin—among others. We are always seeking additional exchange venues that would be a good fit for listing AKT.

For background, the process to be listed on a centralized exchange is arduous. Each exchange has its own economic considerations, its own pipelines, and things to weigh. Simply listing on an exchange will not necessarily drive volume. Product and user adoption is more likely to drive volume over the long term.

### Q: How will the last token unlock affect the price of AKT?

A: _(_[_As before, please listen to Cheng speak directly to this question in the audio recording_](https://youtu.be/1SjcSAQKY7g?t=2311)_)._
