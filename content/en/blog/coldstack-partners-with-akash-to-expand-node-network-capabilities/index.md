As Akash Network continues to scale and onboard new users contributing to Web 3.0, it’s important to have different storage options as the leading decentralized cloud infrastructure provider. 

[ColdStack](https://coldstack.io/), a decentralized cloud aggregator offers a portal to access any decentralized storage network such as Filecoin, Crust, Sia, Arweave, Storj, among others. With a shared vision for a decentralized web, ColdStack has announced plans to deploy on Akash in order to expand its node network capabilities and scale.

> “We see the deployment of these nodes as just the first step in an ongoing technical collaboration with ColdStack. As the metaverse expands and NFTs (which require a great deal of reliance and variation in its storage needs) become more mainstream and widely adopted, it’s important to have affordable, accessible storage that is also in line with the values of Web 3.0. We’re proud to be able to offer decentralized infrastructure as a foundational element of the future of the Internet.”

> Greg Osuri, CEO of Akash Network

Now, any individual can use Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 API methods to upload a file to the file node which allows users to move and manage data with no or minimal coding, making it easy to migrate data from Amazon to ColdStack. Users can retrieve a previously stored file via S3 REST API (by specifying UUID) or via URL (Amazon virtual buckets engine). ColdStack’s file node infrastructure will allow us to eventually implement a full-scale caching service that will be able to cache files during file retrieval. Deploying these nodes to Akash makes it so you can pair the reliability of S3 with the sustainability of Akash’s Network.

### Technical Details

The collaboration will begin with ColdStack deploying its file nodes to the Akash Network which will play a key role in the overall infrastructure. At the time of this partnership, all testing has been completed and ColdStack has already deployed its node, which is now in operation. 

> "Our team is very happy with how well the integration with Akash has gone. The node deployment process was incredibly easy, and we’re already seeing a boost in our performance. We’re looking forward to deploying more file nodes on Akash, and incorporating their infrastructure even further in the future.”

File nodes are responsible for all interactions during the data uploading/downloading process. These nodes record the metadata regarding an individual's files and replicate it in order to eventually recall a user’s metadata. Metadata contains the file size and hash (to control the file’s integrity), a specific user’s wallet hash, and a record of which gateway node the file node eventually interacts with. This metadata is securely stored on the blockchain and can be easily verified.

### **Why It Matters**

Web 3.0 is a vision of true decentralization so that “the power” sits not in the hands of larger corporations, or what some refer to as the Big 5, but with the majority. Web 3.0 prioritizes ownership over your own digital identity, a term we like to refer to as self-sovereignty. 

To get to the next generation of the Internet, the web needs to truly be decentralized and that starts with layer 1; decentralizing your cloud infrastructure. Rather than hosting its nodes with a centralized entity, ColdStack combines the immutability provided by decentralization with the reliability of a traditional hosting service through Akash Network. This ultimately improves the overall decentralization of its network, making decentralized storage more affordable and easy to access.
