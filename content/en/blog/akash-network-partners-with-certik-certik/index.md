At Akash, we’ve been fortunate to partner with organizations who share our vision for an open, safe, and unstoppable cloud that unlocks capabilities for the data-driven technologies of the future. 

Today, we’re thrilled to announce a partnership with [CertiK](https://www.certik.io/), the leading Blockchain and Smart Contract Cybersecurity company. CertiK Chain provides developers with coding safeguards and flexibility, facilitating blockchain adoption for developers and large enterprises while empowering trust in blockchain technology. 

This partnership materializes the potential and promise of Web3. To demonstrate Web 3.0’s capabilities, Jay Jie’s CertiK nodes were deployed on Akash MAINNET 2, the world’s first decentralized cloud, via Starlink WiFi. 

Through this partnership, CertiK’s clients will be able to decentralize their cloud infrastructure on Akash’s permissionless, censorship-resistant, and lower cost open-source cloud platform, while ensuring on-chain protection backed by CertiK’s trusted products and services. Akash Network’s community will be able to leverage CertiK’s industry-leading suite of security solutions to secure deployments and node operations on decentralized cloud.

> At CertiK, we've always admired what Akash has done for the general Cosmos community and the blockchain industry as a whole. We are a true believer in the DeCloud movement led by Akash Network. As we are seeing more and more projects joining the web3 revolution, it is only right if CertiK and Akash join forces to deliver a secure, scalable, and truly decentralized cloud that is not only cost-efficient but also powered by the people.

With [Akash MAINNET 2](https://akash.network/blog/akash-decloud-mainnet-2-teaser/), decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized applications (dApp), and decentralized organizations (DAO), will now be able to migrate from their existing centralized cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, to Akash, the first viable decentralized cloud solution in the market.  And now with CertiK, they can layer on monitoring and security, providing an extra layer of protection in the DeCloud.

Akash Network and CertiK are also exploring the possibility of deploying Pancake Swap’s front-end on a decentralized cloud to demonstrate the capabilities of a censorship-resistant and permissionless cloud, protected by CertiK’s cloud security product, [CertiKShield](https://shield.certik.foundation/), a decentralized on-chain tool to reimburse lost or stolen assets. DeFi protocols and users can leverage CertiKShield as a hedge against audits. 

> We’re thrilled to partner with CertiK, a leader and pioneer in blockchain cybersecurity, to enable DeFi and blockchain projects to decentralize their cloud infrastructure, while layering on cutting-edge monitoring and security technologies. Together, we will expand the capabilities of Web3, enabling developers to build faster, with more freedom and security, and at lower cost.
