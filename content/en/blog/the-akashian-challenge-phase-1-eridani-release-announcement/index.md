**With 211 Teams and 91 Active Validators (for 64 spots at Mainnet), The Akashian Challenge is now the largest testnet in the Cosmos hub since Cosmos’ Game of Stakes.**  
  
Last week, our testnet withstood an AWS outage that brought down the centralized cloud (and internet). It also weathered a massive zero fee transaction attack. You can check out an excellent [summary of the attack](https://medium.com/@novysf/the-outcome-from-akash-testnet-zero-fee-transaction-attack-5fd4aaa68d97) by Russian Validators Club.  
  
Both the AWS outage and the attack showcased the resilience of our platform--The Akashian Challenge testnet kept going strong!   
  
We also found a bug in the Sirius Network Upgrade last week, and we'll be sharing an update with you in the next few days.  
  
This week, we announce Eridani, the third release in Phase 1 of The Akashian Challenge. With 3,000,000 AKT in rewards and 64 validator spots for Mainnet, the stakes are high!   
  
As with Sirius release last week, the goal of Eridani release is to test governance and voting, and network upgrades. The Eridani Upgrade Proposal **goes live for voting Tuesday May 19th at 1600 UTC**.  
   
Be sure to check the schedule and details below, before voting.  
  
And don’t miss **The Akashian Challenge Live Stream Event this Friday, May 22nd at 4pm UTC**! We’ll be presenting awards and giving attendees a chance to win a [Supermini](https://akash.network/supermini/). Details below.
