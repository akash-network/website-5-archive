### **Sirius Release**

Sirius, the second release of The Akashian Challenge: Phase 1, starts tomorrow with the Sirius Upgrade Proposal, which **goes live tomorrow May 12th at 1600 UTC . There are a total of 334 AKT rewards for completion of Sirius.**  
  
The new governance proposal will be created to upgrade the software to v0.6.4.  
  
Just an update that we'll be replacing Proposal (1) for Sirius upgrade with a new Proposal (2) that has the corrected voting period to ensure all participants in the community get to vote.  
  
We'd initially communicated that the voting period would end on May 14th, 2020, 1600 UTC, when we'd publicly indicated that the voting period ends on May 13th, 2020, 12:19:26pm UTC:

*   We created Proposal (1) on May 11th, 2020, 12:19: 07 am UTC with an expectation of submitting the deposit on May 12th, 2020, 1600 UTC and a voting period deadline of May 14th, 2020 1600 UTC.
    
*   A community member ended up posting a deposit instead of us (which will not happen on Mainnet), resulting in a voting period deadline of May 13th, 2020, 12:19:26pm UTC.
    
*   Since this caused the voting period to end sooner than what was initially communicated, we're replacing the current upgrade proposal to ensure all participants get to vote.
    

**The proposal details will be shared at 1600UTC on May 12th**.
