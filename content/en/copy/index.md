# Akash Network Website

Sovereign Infrastructure That Scales

## Benefits

Akash is an open-source Supercloud that lets users buy and sell computing resources securely and efficiently. Purpose-built for public utility.

### You will own your cloud, and you will be happy

Discover the full potential of cloud computing with Akash. Deploy your own cloud infrastructure and optimize it by selling unused capacity to the network. Access this distributed network of cloud resources to run applications on demand.

### Supercloud at your fingertips, at a price you choose

Akash is the innovative supercloud network that makes it easy to rapidly scale and access services around the world. It uses a "reverse auction" system, where customers submit their desired price and providers compete for the business. This often results in prices up to 85% lower than other cloud systems.

### Built for battle, commanded by the community

Akash is owned and managed by its community. It is a free public service, and the source code that powers it is available to everyone. It has been built on dependable technologies like Kubernetes and Cosmos, and the community oversees all aspects of Akash, including decisions about what new features should be implemented.

## Features

### Infrastructure as Code

Akash's orchestration layer lets you use a language called SDL, which is written in YAML and easy to understand. Using this, you can create complex deployments that span multiple areas and providers. You can choose the resources you want to use and decide on your price too.

### Kubernetes Based

Akash runs on Kubernetes, the industry-leading container orchestration system. With this in place, you can rest assured that your applications will be hosted on a secure and reliable platform that has been tested and proven to work.

### Persistent Storage

Akash offers a storage system that doesn't have limits and lets you keep data even after restarting, ideal for databases and programs that store large datasets.

### Dedicated IP Leasing

Akash gives you the ability to rent a dedicated IP address for your application. This allows you to assign any port of your choice to your deployment, and then direct traffic towards it. This is especially useful for services such as DNS, web servers, and more

### Censorship-resistant and unstoppable

Deploying applications on Akash is open to everyone, and is secure and censorship-proof. Nobody can stop you from using Akash to build apps that can't be censored

### Pseudonymous and non-attributable

The Akash protocol is designed to protect your identity, providing a high level of privacy and security. You can use it to deploy applications anonymously, without anyone knowing who you are.

### Peer-to-peer and Private

You and the provider you're using to deploy your application communicate directly, without any external parties. This makes sure your data stays secure and private, and no one can claim a portion of your payments or keep track of what's happening. Furthermore, Akash's lack of central control makes it dependable and unaffected by single point of failure.

### Layer One Protocol

Akash is a blockchain protocol built using Cosmos SDK that uses Proof-of-Stake consensus to secure its network of decentralized validators. The network can be validated without permission and is secured by AKT, its native token.

### Interoperable with IBC

Akash is the first blockchain to successfully carry out an Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) transaction with Cosmos Hub. This makes Akash able to communicate natively with other blockchains that are also IBC compatible.
