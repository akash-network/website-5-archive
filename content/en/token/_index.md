# Akash Network Token (AKT)

Akash Network Token (AKT) is the native utility token of Akash Network. AKT is used as the primary means to govern the network, secure the blockchain, incentivize participants, and provide a default mechanism to store and exchange value.

##### Security

Akash Network is secured by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, and AKT is used to secure the network by staking. Staking AKT provides a passive income stream for stakers, and increases the security of the network.

##### Governance

Akash Network is community-owned and all aspects of the network are governed by AKT holders. AKT holders can vote on proposals to improve the network and manage critical parameters such as the inflation rate and take rates.

##### Value Exchange

AKT provides a default mechanism to store and exchange value, and acts as a reserve currency in Cosmos' multi-currency and multi-chain ecosystem.

##### Incentivization

AKT is used to incentivize providers to offer lower prices, and incentivizes stakers to participate in the network longer term by staking.
